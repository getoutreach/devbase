## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this RFC. Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
-->

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the RFC. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this RFC? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this RFC is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

## Testing and Release Plan

<!--
**Note:** Not required until targeted at a release

This should contain things like; e2e, integration, and unit tests for this RFC.

Try to be as detailed as possible about this, while keeping in mind it's acceptable
to defer this to later if there is ambiguity around how to test this at the time.
-->

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a RFC should be tracked in this section.

Major milestones might include:
- the date this was created
- the date this was merged, signaling acceptance
- the date implementation started
- the first release of the project where this was available
- the first stable release of the project where this was available
- when this feature was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this RFC _not_ be implemented? If any reason.
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
