## How to use a Custom Build of `devbase`

### Bootstrap / Stencil

To test a custom build of `devbase` with bootstrap, simply modify `bootstrap.lock` to point to your branch / version.

**Example**: To use `jaredallard/feat/my-cool-feature` instead of `v1.8.0`, you'd update `versions.devbase` to the former. Full example below:

```yaml
# THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
# vim: set syntax=yaml:
version: v7.4.2
generated: 2021-07-15T18:33:49Z
versions:
  devbase: jaredallard/feat/my-cool-feature
```

CI will now use that branch, to use it locally re-run any `make` command. **Note**: This will not automatically update locally when the remote branch is changed, in order to do that you will need to `rm -rf .bootstrap` and re-run a `make` command. If you are testing changes to `make e2e`, you must also run
`rm -rf ~/.outreach/.cache/gobin/binaries/$(go version | awk '{ print $3 }' | tr -d 'go')/github.com/getoutreach/devbase` before re-running a make command, in addition to `rm -rf .bootstrap`.

## Building Docker Images

Docker images can be built by creating a `docker.yaml` file in the `deployments/` directory of a repository. The format of this file is as follows:

```yaml
# Corresponds to the directory in `deployments/` and is used, by default, as the image name (see special case below).
# If this is equal to "appName" then the build context/image name is changed. See docs.
image_name:
  # Override the build context for the image. Defaults to '.' if image_name == appName, otherwise ./deployments/<image_name>
  buildContext: .
  # pushTo is a different image registry to push to, defaults to:
  # (box: .devenv.imageRegistry)/$image (or, if not == appName, $appname/$image)
  pushTo: docker.com/stable/athens
  # extra secrets to expose to the builder, defaults to NPM_TOKEN being exposed
  # See: https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information
  secrets:
    - id=mySecret,env=MY_SECRET_ENV_VARIABLE
  # Platforms to build this image for, defaults to linux/amd64,linux/arm64
  # See: https://github.com/docker/buildx#building-multi-platform-images
  platforms:
    - linux/amd64
```
